Developed a forecasting model using Python to predict trends over time based on historical and real-time data. Leveraged data analysis techniques and visualization tools within a Jupyter Notebook environment to derive actionable insights. The project emphasized the application of predictive analytics to inform decision-making and enhance operational efficiency.

# Forecasting Model using Data Science

A data science project implementing forecasting models for time series analysis and prediction.

## Project Overview

This project implements forecasting models using data science techniques and machine learning algorithms. The main implementation is in a Jupyter notebook (`DS1.ipynb`) that demonstrates the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Forecasting-Model-by-DS-main.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Forecasting-Model-by-DS-main
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook DS1.ipynb
   ```


2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess your data
   - Train the forecasting model
   - Make predictions
   - Evaluate model performance
